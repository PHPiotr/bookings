### What is this for?
This is an exercise api which is used for calculating and aggregating averages and totals of my costs related to flights, buses, trains, hostels bookings.

### Why I develop this?
In order to do something useful (at least for myself) and - at the same time - learn as much as possible,
so that maybe someone will give me a chance eventually.

### How to use this?
Use it viafrontend react app (https://phpiotr.herokuapp.com).
Go to registration page and create an account for yourself.
You will receive an activation link on your email address.
If you are a frequent flyer, then this api might be helpful
in calculating/averaging your bookings' expenses.
